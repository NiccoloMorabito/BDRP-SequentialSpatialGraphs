3 datasets were used in priority
* avenue
* shanghaiTech
* streetScene


For each above, we will build:
* trainingset .pickle data, which only contains normal videos
* testset .pickle data, which contains both normal and abnormal videos
* testset_label .pickle data, which contains test set labels


For now, 
* avenue dataset is ready, some files are compressed as .zip files in order to fit in the uploading size of github.



For all files, you can also see at google drive
